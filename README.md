smartrisk
=========

Risk analysis tool based on NIST SP800-30 methodology and SCAP framework.
The main architecture of this tool is based on one central node and many satellites. The central node keep all necessary informations coming from satellites and from users to process them for risk assessment.
Smartrisk aims to become a open source tool for risk analysis. The strengths of Smartrisk should be the ease of use and the high degree of automation. This automation can be achieved by interfacing with other open source tools such as nmap and ovald√¨.

This is my thesis work, anyone who want to give a hand or helpful suggestions is welcome ;-)
